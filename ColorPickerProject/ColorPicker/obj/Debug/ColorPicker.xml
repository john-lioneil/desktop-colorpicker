 Very special thanks goes out to Danny Blanchard who wrote the original C# control some two years ago.
 Without his original control to model off of - writing my own vb.net version would have been considerably 
 more difficult.  
 
 Where the original code worked well, I did nothing more than convert from C# to vb.net.
 Where I found problems with the original code, I made the necessary corrections.
 
 Thanks again Danny!
